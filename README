Desktop Drawers

What is it?

Desktop drawers gives you easy access to folders that you
use a lot. I use it to keep track of things I need to do, files I
should work on etc.
You can open and close the drawers to make them take less
space. Single click a file to open it, and you can drag and drop
files to place them in the folders.
It's a replicant, so you can place it on the Desktop, for example.
